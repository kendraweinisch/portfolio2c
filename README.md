Welcome to my portfolio! Thank you for dropping by!

As you can see, this is a simple, static page. However, its simplicity is its genius. I have followed the tenets of UX/UI design by concentrating the navbar and logo in the top-left corner. This is because the reader's eye naturally goes to the top-left corner for essential information (by the way, if I'd included a Search bar, the reader would have looked for it in the top-right corner).

For marketing purposes, I used a classic image (Andy Warhol's Mona Lisa) and a simple tagline that summarizes the web devlopment work I do.

For UX/UI purposes, the "action items," the buttons for visiting portfolio sites, are large and bright. They also open to new browser windows, as users prefer.
